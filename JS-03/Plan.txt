Plan: 
Make a programme that accepts number from a prompt
    - Upon loading site, prompt activated and asks for number. X
        - WHILE input is not a number, loop prompt until number is given. X
    - If a number, progress through application, if not a number ask for number and start again.
- programme cycles through number starting at 0 and ending a the inputted number 
    - Number stored in let/const is used in for loop
- programme checks if cycled number is divisable by 3, 5, or both.
        - If not divisable by any: PRINT NUMBER.
        - If divisable by 3 only: PRINT 'Fizz'.
        - If Divisable by 5 only: PRINT 'Buzz'.
        - If Divisable by both: PRINT 'FizzBuzz'
- End programme when inputted number at the end is checked "Thank you for playing!"
