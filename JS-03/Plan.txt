Understand:
- make a programme that accepts number from a prompt
- programme cycles through number starting at 0 and ending a the inputted number 
- programme checks if cycled number is divisable by 3, 5, or both.
        - If not divisable by any: PRINT NUMBER.
        - If divisable by 3 only: PRINT 'Fizz'.
        - If Divisable by 5 only: PRINT 'Buzz'.
        - If Divisable by both: PRINT 'FizzBuzz'
- End programme when inputted number at the end is checked.
